6. Teacher & Staff Overview

Total number of teachers and staff.

Teacher-to-student ratio.






9. Visual Analytics

Graphs/charts for quick insights:

Bar chart: Students per class.

Line chart: Fee collection trends.

Pie chart: Attendance or gender distribution.

Heatmaps: Performance per subject/class.

10. Optional Advanced Metrics

Correlation between attendance and academic performance.

Fee arrears vs. academic performance.

Term-over-term improvement metrics.

Essentially, the principal’s section is dashboard-heavy, mostly GET requests, showing summaries, lists, and charts. All actions should be view-only, maybe with filters for class, term, or year.

If you want, I can draft a full Vue/Django dashboard layout for the principal, including the API endpoints and Vue components for each of these sections. It would be ready to plug into your current system.

Do you want me to do that?

Perfect! Let’s focus on Student Enrollment & Demographics first. The goal here is to give the principal a clear picture of who is enrolled, how many, and basic breakdowns.

Data to Show

Total students

Simple total count.

Can also show per academic year or term.

Students per class/grade

Number of students in each grade or class.

Can be shown as a table or bar chart.

Gender distribution

Count of male vs. female students.

Optionally, a pie chart for quick visualization.

Optional: Age distribution

If you track birthdates, you can show ranges (e.g., 6–8 years, 9–11 years).

Histogram or bar chart works well.

Enrollment trends (Optional advanced)

Show how enrollment has changed over past terms or years.

Useful for spotting growth or decline.

API Design (GET requests)

Assuming a Django backend:
